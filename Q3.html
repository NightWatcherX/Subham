      <p>This is the Right answer.<br>Here are some information about this<br><br>Computer Based Information System (CBIS) is an information system in which the computer plays a major role. Such a system consists of the following elements:<br>
Hardware: The term hardware refers to machinery. This category includes the computer itself, which is often referred to as the central processing unit (CPU), and all of its support equipment’s. Among the support equipment’s are input and output devices, storage devices and communications devices.<br>
Software: The term software refers to computer programs and the manuals (if any) that support them. Computer programs are machine-readable instructions that direct the circuitry within the hardware parts of the Computer Based Information System (CBIS) to function in ways that produce useful information from data. Programs are generally stored on some input / output medium-often a disk or tape.<br>
Data: Data are facts that are used by program to produce useful information. Like programs, data are generally stored in machine-readable from on disk or tape until the computer needs them.<br>To know more <a href="https://www.mbaknol.com/management-information-systems/computer-based-information-systems-and-its-types/">Click Here</a></p>
