      <p>This is the Right answer.<br>Here are some information about this<br><br>A transaction processing system (TPS) is a type of information system that handles business transactions involving the collection, modification, and retrieval of data. A TPS can process transactions in two ways: batch processing or real-time processing. Batch processing groups similar transactions together and processes them at a scheduled time, while real-time processing processes transactions as they occur, without any delay. A TPS has four main components: inputs, outputs, storage, and processing system. Inputs are the requests for products or payments that come from outside parties, outputs are the documents or reports that the TPS generates after processing the inputs, storage is where the TPS keeps the data related to the transactions, and processing system is the software and hardware that perform the operations on the data. A TPS can offer several benefits to a business, such as increased transaction speed, improved cost efficiency, automated management, and enhanced reliability. Some examples of TPS are point of sale systems, online banking systems, inventory management systems, and payroll systems<br>To know more <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-transaction-processing-system">Click Here</a></p>
